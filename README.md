Title: Productive Procrastination
Premise: When your work is dragging, come fill out our simple quiz to decide which method of procrastination you would most benefit from.

Structure: The website consists of five main sections.
        1. The Home Page
            a. The initial page, our index.html. This is just the starting point for users, which will direct them to either log in or register.
        2. Log-in/Register
            a. To allow for more advanced capabilities, we have all of our users register with us and login for each use. We use a hash to ensure
            password privacy as well as some stop measures to prevent invalid usernames + passwords and making sure there are no doubled usernames.
        3. Quiz Page
            a. This is the main part of the page. The quiz is comprised of 8 questions, all of them on the scale from "Strongly Disagree" to 
            "Strongly Agree." The user just needs to read the questions and pick which answers best apply to them. The way the quiz is structured,
            two questions apply to each of the four categories of potential procrastionation: self-care, productivity, movement, and creativity. 
            This quiz will help us evaluate which one you need the most right now.
                Also, note the other option at the bottom. Instead of taking the quiz, you can click the "Click to suffer!" button. 
        4. Results
            a. When we say this is its own section, we say that with a wink. Technically, this is still displayed on the same page, however, it 
            rescripts the whole page to change its appearance. After a user fills out the quiz, the website compiles their scores and decides 
            which one is most needed at the present moment. If there are any ties, the nature of the code will prioritize movement, then self-care,
            then creativity, then productivity. Research and personal experience have shown that in the general case, this is the order of priority
            for revitalizing a dragging work session.
                Depending on which result you get, your results page will pop up with a short explanation, and a few ideas of what might be helpful 
            to get back in the zone. (Our personal favorite is dancing to the Taylor Swift playlist) This might include links to some useful sights,
            a prompt to write or draw, or even just a reminder to sleep/eat. 
        5. To Do List
            a. This is another capability that we added to further improve our website's ability to support its users. They can also put all of their
            work in our to-do list, which can be accessed at any point. It will also be connected to the results page if the user gets productivity. 
            This allows them to feel more in control of what task they have and try to see if there are any small tasks that will feel good to get off
            of their plate.
