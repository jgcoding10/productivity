Title: Productive Procrastination
Premise: When your work is dragging, come fill out our simple quiz to decide which method of procrastination you would most benefit from.

Structure: The website consists of five main sections.
        1. The Home Page
            a. The initial page with index.html. This is the starting point for users, which will direct them to either log in or register.
        2. Log-in/Register
            a. Users create accounts to register with us and login for each use. We use a hash to ensure password privacy as well as some stop measures to prevent invalid usernames + passwords and making sure there are no doubled usernames. This allows users to log back into their most recent ToDo list as well, seen below.
        3. Quiz Page
            a. This is the main part of the page. The quiz is comprised of 8 questions, all of them on the scale from "Strongly Disagree" to 
            "Strongly Agree." The user just needs to read the questions and pick which answers best apply to them. Two questions apply to each of the four categories of potential procrastionation: self-care, productivity, movement, and creativity. 
            This quiz will help us evaluate which one you need the most right now.
                Also, note the other option at the bottom. Instead of taking the quiz, you can click the "Click to suffer!" button for a fun surprise. 
        4. Results
            a. When we say this is its own section, we say that with a wink. Technically, this is still displayed on the same page, however, it rescripts the whole page to change its appearance. After a user fills out the quiz, the website compiles their scores and displays one of the four appropriate catagories. If there are any ties, the nature of the code will prioritize movement, then self-care, then creativity, then productivity. Research and personal experience have shown that in the general case, this is the order of priority for revitalizing a dragging work session.
                Depending on which result you get, your results page will pop up with a short explanation, and a few ideas of what might be helpful to get back in the zone (our personal favorite is dancing to the Taylor Swift playlist). To further improve our website's productive capabilities, users can put all of their
            work in our to-do list, which can be accessed at any point. The Todo List will also be connected to the results page if the user gets productivity. 
            This allows users to feel more in control of their desired tasks and serve as an organizational tool for any small tasks that will feel good to check off on the list. 
                The to do list allows you to add custom events, check off those
            events, and delete them. This creates a useful and visually-appealing method of organizing your tasks for the day.  Maybe you're not in the mood to write your paper, but you have time to finish a few math questions. This allows you to feel productive, get things done, while still procrastinating!
